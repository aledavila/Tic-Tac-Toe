# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Star Wars themed tic tac toe game! 

On page load Star Wars logo shows up on page and intro scrolls up Star Wars style. It will last for a minute and then fade out. But you can begin the game whenever you want.

When hovering over boxes the box changes color so you know what box you are clicking and if it available. 

Darth Vader is player one and has a Darth Vader icon. 

Luke Skywalker is player two and has a green lightsaber icon.

If Vader wins "Luke I am your father!" will come up on the screen. 

If Luke wins "Who's the father now b**ch" will come up on the screen.

If a tie "Luke the force is with you but you are not a Jedi yet!" will come up on the screen. 

The "Fight Again" button will reset the page and you can start again.


I vanilla JS for the Star Wars logo. 

I used Bootstrap to design my page layout and look.

I use jQuery for the game logic.

I also implemented the code used for star wars animations.
